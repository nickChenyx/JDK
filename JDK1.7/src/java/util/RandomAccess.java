/**
 * Marker interface used by <tt>List</tt> implementations to indicate that
 * they support fast (generally constant time) random access.  The primary
 * purpose of this interface is to allow generic algorithms to alter their
 * behavior to provide good performance when applied to either random or
 * sequential access lists.
 *
 * <p>The best algorithms for manipulating random accss lists (such as
 * <tt>ArrayList</tt>) can produce quadratic behavior when applied to
 * sequential access lists (such as <tt>LinkedList</tt>).  Generic list
 * algorithms are encouraged to check whether the given list is an
 * <tt>instanceof</tt> this interface before applying an algorithm that would
 * provide poor performance if it were applied to a sequential access list,
 * and to alter their behavior if necessary to guarantee acceptable
 * performance.
 *
 * <p>It is recognized that the distinction between random and sequential
 * access is often fuzzy.  For example, some <tt>List</tt> implementations
 * provide asymptotically linear access times if they get huge, but constant
 * access times in practice.  Such a <tt>List</tt> implementation
 * should generally implement this interface.  As a rule of thumb, a
 * <tt>List</tt> implementation should implement this interface if,
 * for typical instances of the class, this loop:
 * <pre>
 *     for (int i=0, n=list.size(); i &lt; n; i++)
 *         list.get(i);
 * </pre>
 * runs faster than this loop:
 * <pre>
 *     for (Iterator i=list.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
 *         i.next();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

/* 如果集合类是RandomAccess的实现，则尽量用for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) 来遍历而不要用Iterator迭代器来遍历。
 * 反过来，如果List是Sequence List，则最好用迭代器来进行迭代。
 * 例如对 ArrayList就for， 对 LinkedList用 iterator，反之速度会有较大差异。
